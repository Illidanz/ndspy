``ndspy.codeCompression``: Code Compression
===========================================

.. py:module:: ndspy.codeCompression

``ndspy.codeCompression`` provides functions for the compression format used
for executable code files.

This compression format is sometimes unofficially known as "BLZ" ("backwards
LZ"). It's essentially the same as LZ10 compression, except that the file is
decompressed in reverse, beginning at the end of the file. This allows for
in-place decompression on the console.

.. note::
    If you're using the :py:mod:`ndspy.code` module, compression is handled
    automatically for you, and you shouldn't need to use this module
    explicitly.

.. seealso::

    This module also includes a :doc:`command-line interface
    <../cli/codeCompression>`.


.. py:function:: compress(data[, isArm9=False])

    Compress code data. This is the inverse of :py:func:`decompress`.

    :param bytes data: The data to compress.

    :param bool isArm9: Whether the data to be compressed is a main ARM9 code
        file or not. ARM9 code needs to be compressed slightly differently.
        (This should be ``False`` for overlays.)

        :default: ``False``

    :returns: The compressed data.
    :rtype: :py:class:`bytes`


.. py:function:: compressFromFile(filePath[, isArm9=False])

    Load a filesystem file, and compress its contents. This is the inverse of
    :py:func:`decompressToFile`, and is a convenience function.

    :param filePath: The path to the file to open.
    :type filePath: :py:class:`str` or other path-like object

    :param bool isArm9: Equivalent to the same parameter in the
        :py:func:`compress` function.

    :returns: The compressed data.
    :rtype: :py:class:`bytes`


.. py:function:: compressToFile(data, filePath[, isArm9=False])

    Compress data in the code compression format, and save it to a filesystem
    file. This is the inverse of :py:func:`decompressFromFile`, and is a
    convenience function.

    :param bytes data: The data to compress.

    :param filePath: The path to the compressed file to save to.
    :type filePath: :py:class:`str` or other path-like object

    :param bool isArm9: Equivalent to the same parameter in the
        :py:func:`compress` function.


.. py:function:: decompress(data)

    Decompress data that was compressed using code compression. This is the
    inverse of :py:func:`compress`.

    If the data does not seem to be compressed, it will be returned unmodified.

    :param bytes data: The compressed data.

    :returns: The decompressed data.
    :rtype: :py:class:`bytes`


.. py:function:: decompressFromFile(filePath)

    Load a filesystem file that is compressed using code compression, and
    decompress it. This is the inverse of :py:func:`compressToFile`, and is a
    convenience function.

    :param filePath: The path to the compressed file to open.
    :type filePath: :py:class:`str` or other path-like object

    :returns: The decompressed data.
    :rtype: :py:class:`bytes`


.. py:function:: decompressToFile(data, filePath)

    Decompress data that was compressed using code compression, and save it to
    a filesystem file. This is the inverse of :py:func:`compressFromFile`, and
    is a convenience function.

    :param bytes data: The data to decompress.

    :param filePath: The path to the file to save to.
    :type filePath: :py:class:`str` or other path-like object


.. py:function:: main([args])

    This is the main function for :doc:`this module's command-line interface
    <../cli/codeCompression>`. This allows you to invoke the CLI
    programmatically, if you would like.

    :param args: The command-line arguments. Defaults to ``sys.argv`` if not
        provided.
    :type args: :py:class:`list` of :py:class:`str`
